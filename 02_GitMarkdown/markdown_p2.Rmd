You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars, }
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Or if you have multiple plots:
```
## Sales Report {.tabset}
 
### By Product
 
(tab content)
 
### By Region
 
(tab content)
```
## Multiple plots {.tabset}
 
### By class
 
```{r}
g <- ggplot(mpg, aes(class))
# Number of cars in each class:
g + geom_bar()
```
 
### Boxplot
 
```{r}
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy))
p + geom_boxplot()
```
